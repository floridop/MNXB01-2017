# The script must take in input as an argument the directory where the 
# database is stored.
# for example:
#   ./pokemoninfo.sh dataset/
# note that the name 'dataset' should not be hardcoded. It can be any directory
# name. Make sure to read slides 33,34,39 
# Store the folder name in a variable called DBDIR.
DBDIR=$1

# use this function to show an error message with usage information.
errormsg() {
   echo "Usage:"
   echo "$0 <directory>"
   echo "directory must be a path containing a csv dataset."	
}

### Exercise 1: 1 points
# Write an error and exit if no command line argument exists or if the argument
# is empty (it could be a variable!)
# hint: use the if construct and the proper conditions to verify the arguments

# YOUR CODE HERE
# put an arbitrary letter or string, "x" here, before the argument in order to avoid " " == " "
if [ "x$DBDIR" == "x" ]; then
     echo "No command line argument found. "
     exit 1
fi

### Exercise 2: 1 points
# Write an error and exit if the DBDIR directory does not exist or it's not a directory.
# Hint: read http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html

# YOUR CODE HERE
# -d stands of testing if the input argument is a directory
if [ -d "$DBDIR" ]; then
     echo "The $DBDIR directory is a directory. "
else
     echo "The $DBDIR directory does not exist or it's not a directory. "
     exit 1
fi

### Exercise 3: 1 point
# Use the grep command to find which file contains "Pokémon Red Version"
# and output the results on screen.
# grep examples: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_02.html

echo -e "\nSearching for Pokémon Red..."
# YOUR CODE HERE

# -H prints the file name (not necessary for searching multiple files, since it is the default setting)
# -r does a recursive search
# -n prints the line number
# --color assigns colors to different elements in the search results
grep -H -r -n --color 'Pokémon Red Version' $DBDIR/*.csv

### Exercise 4: 1 point
# delete existing allplatform.csv file in preparation of the next exercise
echo -e "\nRemoving old allplatforms.csv"
# YOUR CODE HERE

# Delete "allplatforms.csv" in the current directory where the code runs
# Test if allplatforms.csv exists in the current directory
if [ -e allplatforms.csv ]; then
    rm allplatforms.csv
    echo "allplatforms.csv has been removed"
else
    echo "allplatforms.csv doesn't exist"
fi


### Exercise 5: 3 points
# Write a for loop that takes every file in the database and puts it 
# into a single file
# called allplatforms.csv.
# Inspect the csv files to understand their structure,
# and make sure to remove the header lines.
# Hint: use the slides about for ... do ... done
#       use the tail command to remove the header lines (check 'man tail'),
#       use the file concatenator '>>' to write out the allplatforms.csv file

# create allplatforms file with a for loop
echo -e "\nCreating new allplatforms.csv"

# YOUR FOR LOOP HERE
for data in "$DBDIR"/*.csv; do
# Use tail to remove the first row
tail -n +2 $data >> allplatforms.csv
done
echo "New allplatforms.csv successfully created"

### Exercise 4: 1 point
# Sort the contents of the allplatforms.csv file by using the sort 
# command and write the result in allplatforms.ordered.csv
# Hint: use \" as a delimiter for sort. Check 'man sort'
echo -e "\nSorting allplatforms.csv..."
# YOUR CODE HERE
# Remove potentially pre-existing allplatforms.ordered.csv
rm allplatforms.ordered.csv
# Sort the csv based on the second collumn, denoted by -k2, and set the field 
# separater as "," using "-t,". The default sorting is based on alphabetical order.
sort -t, -k2 allplatforms.csv >> allplatforms.ordered.csv

# Exercise 5: 4 points
# Write a for loop that, for each file, counts all the games
# in each file. Inspect the csv file to understand the structure of the 
# csv file to get the right numbers.
# Hint: use the slides about for ... do ... done
#       use the '$()' syntax to put the output of a command inside a variable
#       use the program tail to get rid of useless lines
#       use the program wc to count things
#       make use of the | symbol to compose         
#       use the 'basename' command to get rid of the directory part of the filename
# output the result in this form:
# <filename> has <number of games> games <newline>
# example output:
# poke.Android.csv has 2 game(s)
# poke.iOS.csv has 1 game(s)
echo -e "\nCalculating number of games for each file..."

#YOUR CODE HERE
# Iterate through each csv file in the DBDIR
for data in "$DBDIR"/*.csv; do
# Use tail to cut the first row and then use wc -l to count the number of lines/rows. 
# Pass the result to variable NofGames.
NofGames="$(tail -n +2 $data | wc -l )"
# Output results 
echo -e "$(basename "$data") has $NofGames game(s)\n" 
done
exit 0;
