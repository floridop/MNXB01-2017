# The script must take in input the directory where the database is stored.
# Stores it in a variable called DBDIR.

#Read dir path
#read DIRECTORY (not used)

#$1 first argument after script call
DBDIR=$1

# use this function to show an error message with usage information.
errormsg() {
   echo "Usage: $1"
   echo "$0 $2"
   echo "directory must be a path containing a csv dataset."	
}

### Exercise 1: 1 points
# Write an error and exit if no parameter exists or if the parameter is empty.
# hint: use the if construct and the proper conditions to verify parameters
# and directory existence.

# YOUR CODE HERE
#Double brackets (( )) for arithmetic expressions, $# number of arguments
if (( $# == 0  )); then
    errormsg "Input argument" "$(pwd)";
    exit 1;
fi

### Exercise 2: 1 points
# Write an error and exit if the DBDIR directory does not exist or it's not a directory.
# Hint: read http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html

# YOUR CODE HERE
# Determine if $DBDIR is a file and if it's a directory
if [ ! -d "$DBDIR" ]; then
    errormsg "Could not detect directory" "$DBDIR";
    exit 1;
fi

### Exercise 3: 1 point
# Use the grep command to find which file contains "Pokémon Red Version"
# and output the results on screen.
# grep examples: http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_02.html

echo -e "\nSearching for Pokémon Red..."

# YOUR CODE HERE
#use read all files recursively in supplied directory (short notation: -r equivalent to "-d recurse")
grep -r "Pokémon Red Version" "$DBDIR"


### Exercise 4: 1 point
# delete existing allplatform.csv file in preparation of the next exercise
echo -e "\nRemoving old allplatforms.csv"

# YOUR CODE HERE
#$(<command>) executes command inside parenthesis and returns the output.
#[ $(<command>) ] returns exit status depending on success of output.
if [ $(find . -name allplatforms.csv) ]; then
    rm $(find . -name allplatforms.csv);
else
    echo "File allplatforms.csv not found";
fi

### Exercise 5: 3 points
# Write a for loop that takes every file in the database and puts it 
# into a single file
# called allplatforms.csv.
# Inspect the csv files to understand their structure,
# and make sure to remove the header lines.
# Hint: use the slides about for ... do ... done
#       use the tail command to remove the header lines (check 'man tail'),
#       use the file concatenator '>>' to write out the allplatforms.csv file

# create allplatforms file with a for loop
echo -e "\nCreating new allplatforms.csv"

# YOUR FOR LOOP HERE
# {} brackets make it easier to spot variable start and end.
# ${<directory>}/* expands directory variable to a list of all sub files.
for file in ${DBDIR}/*; do
    #check if $file has more than 1 row, i.e check for game(s) in file.
    if [ "$(tail -n +2 $file)" ];  then
	# tail -n +K: read from line +K till end of file.
	# print output to allplatforms.csv in current directory of script.
	echo "$(tail -n +2 $file)" >> allplatforms.csv;
    fi
done


### Exercise 4: 1 point
# Sort the contents of the allplatforms.csv file by using the sort 
# command and write the result in allplatforms.ordered.csv
# Hint: use \" as a delimiter for sort. Check 'man sort'
echo -e "\nSorting allplatforms.csv..."
# YOUR CODE HERE
#sort -t <delimiter> -k <kolumn X>,<kolumn Y> -o <output file>
#Uses delimiter comma to determine new kolumns and sort by column 2.
sort -t \, -k 2 -o allplatforms.ordered.csv $(find . -name allplatforms.csv)


# Exercise 5: 4 points
# Write a for loop that, for each file, counts all the games
# in each file. Inspect the csv file to understand the structure of the 
# csv file to get the right numbers.
# Hint: use the slides about for ... do ... done
#       use the '$()' syntax to put the output of a command inside a variable
#       use the program tail to get rid of useless lines
#       use the program wc to count things
#       make use of the | symbol to compose         
#       use the 'basename' command to get rid of the directory part of the filename
# output the result in this form:
# <filename> has <number of games> games <newline>
# example output:
# poke.Android.csv has 2 game(s)
# poke.iOS.csv has 1 game(s)
echo -e "\nCalculating number of games for each file..."

#YOUR CODE HERE

for file in ${DBDIR}/*; do
    #GAMES variable assigned from output of pipe $(<command X>|<command using X output>).
    GAMES=$(tail -n +2 $file | wc -l);
    #Print basename i.e end of file name to screen.
    echo "$(basename $file) has $GAMES game(s)";
done

exit 0;
